Hurray, you just made added your first issue. The managers of amazon clone will now review your issue and you will either get assigned to the issue, have it closed or a comment will be dropped for you.

You have been assigned an issue 🥂 and are confused 😵 about where to go from here, follow this guide below to make your changes and pull request 🍾.

## Getting Started
Fork the Cookie repository. See below 👇

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76417084/193394675-6a74ff28-68d9-44c0-bc13-d64e9ca72ffe.png)

Clone the repository you forked above. See below 👇

![clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76417084/193394752-80fbfd80-499a-4477-9c5b-2de1895d2a1f.png)

Using the command below, you can clone the repo.
```

```

Navigate to the cloned directory using command line. See below 👇

```
cd cookie
```

Make a new branch.
```
git checkout -b "Your Branch Name"
```

A good branch name would begin with the issue ticket and the assigned issue. See below 👇

eg..
```

git checkout -b "#53-make a request"
```

You are all set!! 🍾🎉. You can now make your changes locally. Once you are done making all your changes, you can now push code and make a pull request.

```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
